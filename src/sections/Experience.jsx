            "I worked as a Full-Stack Engineer, designing scalable backend services that reduced user setup time by 40% through building CRUD APIs and secure key management features. On the frontend, I improved application responsiveness by 35% by refactoring React state management and optimizing data flow. In addition to hands-on development, I led my team by assigning tasks, testing implementations, and providing constructive feedback, ensuring code quality and alignment with project goals. I also enhanced the accuracy of AI-driven applications by integrating and fine-tuning our MCP server, improving data relevancy and user experience.",

            "As a Software Engineer Intern at Bilimetrix USA, I contributed across the full development lifecycle to improve our diagnostic software, utilizing a C# Microsoft Blazor codebase. A major accomplishment was engineering a pixel-brightness-based shadow detector that enhanced diagnostic accuracy by 20% through algorithm design for medical image analysis. I significantly improved code quality by centralizing redundant mock data into a helper module, which increased unit test maintainability by 30%. Furthermore, I ensured reliable production releases by actively participating in design discussions, managing GitHub source version control, and implementing CI pipelines and comprehensive unit tests to maintain 100% code coverage. I also leveraged Microsoft Azure for application deployment and hosting",

            "As a Research Associate, I was part of an undergraduate research team focused on evolutionary robotics and predator-prey simulations. I significantly enhanced neural network robustness by extending input capacity for binocular vision, leading to a 25% improvement in accuracy for agent behaviors. We utilized the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm to model complex behavioral dynamics and enable agents to evolve sophisticated hunting and gathering strategies. This experience culminated in co-authoring a research paper, demonstrating strong research and communication skills.",
